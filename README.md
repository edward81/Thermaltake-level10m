![screen](https://github.com/edward81/Thermaltake-level10m/raw/master/media/level_10m_gui_preview.jpg)  
Little gui written in python3 that allow you to change some setting on the thermaltake mouse.

Additional python3 package requied:  
- python-pyqt4  
- python-pyusb  

What work:  
- Assigning buttons function.  
- Change dpi settings.  
- Edit profile colors.

What not:  
- You can't create or assign new macro.  
- If the program crash the mouse stop working. You have to detach and reattach the Usb cable (can't fix. This need a kernel driver to work properly).  
- Other random things. This is a pre pre alpha version. And i don't know if i continue the development. But i think that may be useful to someone
